A Python Client for The Lacuna Expanse.

This is essentially a port of the Perl Games::Lacuna::Client module to Python.  

## TBD
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
- ships_report.py doesn't appear to be reporting on fighters that have been 
  recalled from a deployment
  - Are we just reporting on Docked ships?  If so, the report should have the 
    option of displaying other tasks, and should make clear what it's 
    displaying.
- see stats.py for how methods should be documented throughout.

- Ack through everything for "CHECK" and fix.
  - Even if you find no CHECK marks, leave this list item here.  I have a tendency to 
    re-add these marks.
