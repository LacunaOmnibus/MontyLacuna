INCLUDING AN IMAGE
    .. |my_image_tag| image:: images/some_image.png

    (...time passes...)

    Here's an image to illustrate stuff:
        |my_image_tag|


LINKING TO AN ARBITRARY SECTION IN ANOTHER FILE

    To create the anchor, you must identify the anchor name, and that anchor 
    name must start with an underscore and appear above a section header:

        .. _my_anchor_name:

        My Linked Section
        -----------------

    To link to that from another file:
        Here we will link to :ref:`my_anchor_name`


    So in the link we don't use the underscore.  What displays is the text "My 
    Linked Section", hyperlinked to jump to that section.
