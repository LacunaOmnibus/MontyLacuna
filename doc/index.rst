Welcome to MontyLacuna's documentation!
=======================================

There's a lot of information here, but if you just want to get yourself set up 
to run MontyLacuna scripts, and don't want (yet, at least) to write them, just 
read the :ref:`getting_started` section down to where it tells you to stop, 
and ignore the rest.
