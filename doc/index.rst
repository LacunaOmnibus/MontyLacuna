Welcome to MontyLacuna's documentation!
=======================================

There's a lot of information here, but if you just want to get yourself set up 
to run MontyLacuna scripts, and don't want (yet, at least) to write them, just 
read the :ref:`getting_started` section down to where it tells you to stop, 
and ignore the rest.

.. In the toctree,
   - The first grouping are intro-y sections, whose titles are capitalized.
   - The next grouping are modules that mirror modules documented by the TLE 
     API, and their titles are "TLE Module - Modulename"
   - The next grouping are Non-TLE classes and utilities.
   #
   I apparently can't put comments inside the toctree section, so leave this 
   up here.
