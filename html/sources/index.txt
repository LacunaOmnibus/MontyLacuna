Welcome to MontyLacuna's documentation!
=======================================

<<<<<<< HEAD
There's a lot of information here, but if you only want to get yourself set up 
to run MontyLacuna scripts, read the :ref:`getting_started_running` section to 
get your system set up, then the :ref:`scripts_index` section to figure out 
how to run the various available scripts.  You can ignore everything else.

There's a lot of information here, but if you just want to get yourself set up 
to run MontyLacuna scripts, and don't want (yet, at least) to write them, just 
read the :ref:`getting_started_running` section down to where it tells you to 
stop, and ignore the rest.

.. In the toctree,
   - The first grouping are intro-y sections, whose titles are capitalized.
   - The next grouping are modules that mirror modules documented by the TLE 
     API, and their titles are "TLE Module - Modulename"
   - The next grouping are Non-TLE classes and utilities.
   #
   I apparently can't put comments inside the toctree section, so leave this 
   up here.
