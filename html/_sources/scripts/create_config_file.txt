Create Config File
==================

Creates a fresh new config file in ``ROOT/etc/lacuna.cfg``.  This script 
doesn't require any configuration at all, you can just run it as-is.  It will 
prompt you to answer a few questions, and then create your basic config file.

    >>> python3 bin/create_config_file.py
