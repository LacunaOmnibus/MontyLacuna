### I did have a test script going while I was working on the empire class, 
### but I moronically overwrote it.
###
### There's some leftover junk in run.py to pull into here, then flesh it out 
### with a reasonable number of other examples. 
###
### Then get rid of run.py.

### Be real sure to re-check fetch_captcha against a non-logged-in client.  I 
### think I borked that whole Empire class up to the point where it will no 
### longer work unless the user is logged in.
