Get Pip
=======

Gets and installs pip for you.  Pip is a tool for installing Python libraries, 
similar to the cpan or ppm you might be used to using for installing Perl 
libraries.

This script requires no configuration, just run it::

    >>> python bin/get_pip.py

pip is now installed.

**However**, it's possible that just typing "pip" at the command line will end 
up finding an entirely different program also named ``pip`` -- Strawberry Perl 
comes with such a program.

If you installed ActiveState Python, the full path to your Python ``pip`` 
should be ``c:\Python34\Scripts\pip``.
