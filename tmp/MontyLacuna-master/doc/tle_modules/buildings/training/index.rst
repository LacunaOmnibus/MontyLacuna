Spy Training
============
All four spy training buildings have only a single method, ``view()``, which 
returns a :class:`lacuna.spy.TrainingView` object.


That TrainingView object will tell you how many spies are currently training, 
but you can't get back a list of those spies.  If you need that, see the 
:ref:`intmin` docs.
