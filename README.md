MontyLacuna
===========

A Python Client for The Lacuna Expanse.

This is essentially a port of the Perl Games::Lacuna::Client module to Python.  

## Working On
- train_spies.py
    - This seems to be working well.  Needs more testing, I think, but it's looking good.

## TBD
- The training buildings' view() method returns a lacuna.spy.TrainingView object, but 
  those buildings are listed as "without methods" and the fact that this is what gets 
  returned is not documented.
- Ack through everything for "CHECK" and fix.
  - Even if you find no CHECK marks, leave this list item here.  I have a tendency to 
    re-add these marks.
