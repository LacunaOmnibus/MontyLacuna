MontyLacuna
===========

A Python Client for The Lacuna Expanse.

This is essentially a port of the Perl Games::Lacuna::Client module to Python.  

## TBD
- Ack through everything for "CHECK" and fix.
  - Even if you find no CHECK marks, leave this list item here.  I have a tendency to 
    re-add these marks.

## Docs cleanup
- I've fully walked through all misc buildings with methods and cleaned up their docu.
