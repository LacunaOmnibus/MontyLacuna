Python Client for The Lacuna Expanse

This is essentially a port of the Perl Games::Lacuna::Client module to Python.  
No attempt is being made to preseve the same API used by GLC, but the goal is 
to replicate all of the functionality.

The main goal is to help me learn Python, but I'd like to end up with a fully 
working package.

## Complete
Nothing.

## Working
"working" means that all functionality exists, and quickie scripts appear to 
work, but it hasn't been fully tested yet.
