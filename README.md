MontyLacuna
===========

A Python Client for The Lacuna Expanse.


This is essentially a port of the Perl Games::Lacuna::Client module to Python.  

## TBD
- Add a "beacon" pack to post_starter_kit.py.  It should post one waste for 
  100E.
- Ack through everything for "CHECK" and fix.
  - Even if you find no CHECK marks, leave this list item here.  I have a tendency to 
    re-add these marks.
