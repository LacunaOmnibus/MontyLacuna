A Python Client for The Lacuna Expanse.

This is essentially a port of the Perl Games::Lacuna::Client module to Python.  

## TBD
- Ack through everything for "CHECK" and fix.
  - Even if you find no CHECK marks, leave this list item here.  I have a tendency to 
    re-add these marks.
- Add a per-user planet-name-abbreviation setup somehow (config file?  maybe an 
  interactive script that stores the abbreviations in a database?).  To allow the user to 
  just type "1.1" as an argument instead of "My Planet Number 1.1" wherever a script needs 
  a planet or station name.


## Docs Fixes
