MontyLacuna
===========

A Python Client for The Lacuna Expanse.


This is essentially a port of the Perl Games::Lacuna::Client module to Python.  

## Working on
show_laws.py
    I haven't actually started this yet.  But I do want a script that will 
    spit out all laws active at an SS.

## TBD
- Ack through everything for "CHECK" and fix.
  - Even if you find no CHECK marks, leave this list item here.  I have a tendency to 
    re-add these marks.
