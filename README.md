MontyLacuna
===========

A Python Client for The Lacuna Expanse.

This is essentially a port of the Perl Games::Lacuna::Client module to Python.  

## Working On
- train_spies.py
    - This seems to be working well.  Needs more testing, I think, but it's looking good.

## TBD
- Ack through everything for "CHECK" and fix.
  - Even if you find no CHECK marks, leave this list item here.  I have a tendency to 
    re-add these marks.
