MontyLacuna
===========

A Python Client for The Lacuna Expanse.

This is essentially a port of the Perl Games::Lacuna::Client module to Python.  

## TBD
- Update send_excavs.py to allow for an 'all' planet like build_ships.py uses.
- Everything needs to be tested on Windows.  In particular:
  - bin/captcha_test.py
  - installing modules via pip or however it works on windows.
  - Run through the whole Getting Started instruction set on a fresh Python install on 
    Windows to make sure the docs are correct.
- Ack through everything for "CHECK" and fix.
  - Even if you find no CHECK marks, leave this list item here.  I have a tendency to 
    re-add these marks.
